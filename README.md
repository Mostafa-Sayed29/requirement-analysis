# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository!  

This repository is dedicated to documenting the process of requirement analysis for software projects. It serves as a structured example of how to gather, analyze, and present functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, acceptance criteria, and other essential elements that form the foundation of successful software development.

üìå **Purpose:**  
The goal is to provide a clear and professional blueprint for requirement analysis, helping developers, analysts, and stakeholders align on project goals and ensure the development process starts on a solid foundation.

Stay tuned for detailed documentation, diagrams, and examples!
## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. The primary goal is to clearly define *what* the software system should do (functional requirements) and *how* it should perform (non-functional requirements).

During this phase, development teams work closely with stakeholders to:
- Identify and understand business goals and user needs.
- Translate these needs into precise, actionable requirements.
- Create documentation that serves as the foundation for system design and implementation.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC
Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of software projects. Its key benefits include:
- **Defining clear project scope:** Prevents misunderstandings and scope creep by establishing well-defined boundaries for the system.
- **Aligning stakeholder expectations:** Ensures all parties have a shared understanding of the system‚Äôs purpose and functionality.
- **Guiding design and development:** Provides a solid blueprint for developers and designers to build the right solution.
- **Reducing errors and rework:** Identifies potential issues early, minimizing costly changes during later stages of development.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a cornerstone of successful software development. It ensures that the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations. Below are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Defines Clear Project Scope**  
Requirement Analysis helps set precise boundaries for what the software will and will not do. This clarity prevents scope creep and ensures that all stakeholders are aligned on the project‚Äôs goals from the start.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Reduces Errors and Rework**  
By identifying and addressing requirements early in the development process, Requirement Analysis minimizes misunderstandings and mistakes. This reduces costly changes and rework during later stages of the SDLC.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Guides Design and Development**  
Well-documented requirements provide a solid foundation for designing system architecture and developing features. This ensures that the solution is both functional and aligned with user needs, leading to higher-quality software.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several important activities that help ensure a project‚Äôs success. These activities work together to define, document, and validate the system‚Äôs requirements.

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the process of collecting information from stakeholders about their needs, expectations, and objectives for the system. It often involves interviews, surveys, and reviewing existing documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  In this activity, the development team refines and clarifies gathered information using techniques such as brainstorming, workshops, and prototyping. The goal is to ensure that the requirements are well understood and accurately captured.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  This involves creating detailed records of the system‚Äôs functional and non-functional requirements. The documentation serves as a reference for stakeholders, designers, and developers throughout the project.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  The requirements are analyzed for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Modeling techniques (such as use case diagrams, flowcharts, or data models) are used to visually represent system interactions and processes.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  This final activity ensures that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs. It typically involves reviews, walkthroughs, and approval sessions with stakeholders.
## Types of Requirements

Requirement Analysis categorizes system needs into **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential for ensuring the system delivers value and performs as expected.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define *what* the system should do ‚Äî the features, functions, and business logic that support the user‚Äôs and organization‚Äôs goals.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system must allow users to search for available properties based on location, date, and price.
- The system must enable registered users to book a property and receive a booking confirmation.
- The system must provide an admin interface to manage property listings.
- The system must allow users to cancel bookings within a specified time frame.
- The system must send email notifications upon successful booking or cancellation.

---

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify *how* the system should perform, focusing on quality attributes rather than specific behaviors.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system should load property search results in under 2 seconds.
- The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- The system must comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR.
- The system should provide 99.9% uptime availability.
- All data transmission must be encrypted using HTTPS.
## Use Case Diagrams

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and a system. It illustrates the different ways users can achieve their goals using the system‚Äôs functionality.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- They provide a clear, high-level overview of system functionality.
- They help identify system boundaries, actors, and interactions early in the project.
- They serve as a communication tool between stakeholders, analysts, and developers.
